# Student-Employer Matching Platform - Application Summary

## Overview

This application is a **student-employer matching platform** prototype designed specifically for Memorial University students. It connects students with potential employers through an AI-powered matching system that focuses on skills compatibility and project requirements rather than traditional job postings.

## What This Application Does
